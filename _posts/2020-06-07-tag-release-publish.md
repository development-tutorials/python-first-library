Change current working directory to your project repository...


```bash
cd ~/git/hub/development-tutorials/python-first-library
```


------


Add and commit changes...


```bash
git add .

git commit -m 'Adds source files for Python library'
```


Tag last commit for release and push to GitHub...


```bash
git tag --annotate v0.0.1 -m ':bookmark: Initial RFC'

git push hub master

git push hub v0.0.1
```


Make a new release on GitHub (optional as of Python version 3 or greater)...


- Example: `https://github.com/development-tutorials/python-first-library/releases/new`


- Syntax: _`https://github.com/<Account>/<Repository>/releases/new`_


Publish to PyPi servers


```bash
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```


```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/python-first-library-0.0.1*
# twine upload dist/python-first-library-0.0.1*
```


> Note, there will be new directories and files generated by the build process...
>
> - `build/lib` directory, contains directories and files that will be packaged into an archive
>
> - `dist/` directory, contains archives that will be uploaded to PyPi servers
>
> . `python_first_library.egg-info/` directory, contains various metadata about the library
>
> ... these directories do **not** need to be tracked by Git, so it's generally okay to add patterns to the `.gitignore` file to ignore tracking them by default.


**Warning** if at any point files are removed from the library (eg. via `git rm path`), then file(s) will also need to be removed from the `build/lib` directory structure.
